Yet, we carry with us this ability to connect to Jesus and impact the world around us when we can connect our passions to His purposes. The thing is, we often forget that our families are the same way. We forget that God doesn’t only use “well-behaved” or “perfect” people. God uses people like us and people in our family.By using humans, even in all our imperfections, God’s power is more recognizable. God gets all the credit! Remember, as complicated as your family may feel, God wants to use all of us for good things.Today, look for God doing something in your family you may have missed, and thank God for working in imperfect people."
